# Dice Game Contract

## Project Description
The Dice Game Contract is a provably fair blockchain-based gambling application built on the Aptos blockchain. Players can place bets on dice rolls with transparent, verifiable outcomes while the house maintains a configurable edge to ensure sustainability. The contract implements a simple high/low betting system where players wager on whether a dice roll (1-6) will be high (4-6) or low (1-3).

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize online gambling by providing a completely transparent, decentralized dice game that eliminates trust issues inherent in traditional online casinos. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that every game outcome is verifiable, every transaction is transparent, and the house edge is clearly defined and immutable. We aim to create a fair gaming ecosystem where players can enjoy gambling with complete confidence in the integrity of the system.
